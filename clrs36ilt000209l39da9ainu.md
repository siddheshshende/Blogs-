## Decoding JavaScript functions ❤️

JavaScript functions are more than simply code snippets; they are dynamic entities that generate their own execution contexts when called. Let's look at the essential elements that make functions in JavaScript truly unique:

### 1\. Local Variables and Functional Scope

Functions define their area, known as the variable environment or Memory Component. This distinct space enables for the use of local variables that are restricted to the function's limits. These local variables are secret and only accessible within the function unless expressly shared via closures—a topic we'll discuss later.

### 2.Variable Hoisting in JavaScript

JavaScript has a unique method called variable hoisting. This approach enables functions to be called before they are defined because variable definitions are relocated to the top of their appropriate scopes during the compilation phase. This ensures that functions can be called effortlessly, hence increasing the flexibility of your code.

**The Role of Variable Environment in Execution Context**

### 3.Memory component in the execution context.

The variable environment, often known as the **memory component**, is where variables and functions reside during runtime. Key items to consider:

* Each execution context has its own variable environment, which guarantees isolation.
    
* When a variable is accessed, JavaScript first looks within the local variable environment before moving on to the outer environments and finally the global variable environment.
    
    ### 4.Lexical Scoping for Variable Resolution.
    
    Lexical scoping is made easier by JavaScript's hierarchical variable environment structure. Variables are resolved depending on their closeness to the current execution context, resulting in a reliable and predictable scoping method.
    

**Deep Dive into JavaScript Code Flow**

Let's look at a code snippet to visualize the flow of execution context and variable environments:

```javascript
var x = 1;
a();
b();
console.log(x);

function a() {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x);
}

function b() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x);
}
```

### 5.Step by Step Execution

* The Global Execution Context (GEC) is constructed, and 'x' is initialised to 1.
    
* Function a() is called, which generates a new execution context. Local 'x' within a() is set to ten, and console.log(x) returns 10.
    
* After executing a(), the context is removed from the call stack and returned to GEC.
    
* The function b() is invoked to create a new context. Local 'x' in b() is set to 100, and console.log(x) returns 100.
    
* After executing b(), the context is removed from the call stack and returned to GEC.
    
* Console.log(x) in the global scope returns the global 'x' value of 1.
