In the big theatre of web development, JavaScript takes centre stage, creating a thrilling ballet of code executions. This blog digs into the delicate ballet of <mark>execution contexts </mark> and the <mark> Call Stack</mark>, which acts as a quiet conductor to ensure a faultless performance.

## Introduction: The Opening Act

As the curtains rise on the world of JavaScript, code execution unfolds like a well-choreographed dance. The Call Stack serves as the stage manager, while execution contexts are the lead performers. They perform a mesmerising dance, shifting fluidly between the Memory Creation and Code Execution phases.

Let's take a voyage through the fascinating steps of how JavaScript brings its code to life, producing a symphony of memory allocation, function invocation, and a delicate dance atop the Call Stack.

## Act 1: The Birth of Execution Context.

When a JavaScript programme starts, a global execution context takes centre stage. This act consists of two different stages that set the tone for the entire show.

### 1.Memory Creation Phase: Setting the Stage.

In this starting sequence, JavaScript allocates memory for variables and functions and assigns them initial roles. Imagine the stage is being readied for a great ballet:

```javascript
var n = 2;
function square(num) {
 var ans = num * num;
 return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

The Memory Creation Phase begins, with 'n' and'square' taking their positions in memory, embellished with the mystery of 'undefined.' 'square2' and 'square4' enter the stage, receiving their scripts, and the first act finishes.

### 2\. Code Execution Phase: Dance of the Code.

The music continues when the Code Execution Phase commences. Each line of code has its turn in the spotlight, assigning values and calling functions. The dance of var square2 = square(n) creates a new execution environment. The programme allocates memory and assigns values before gracefully exiting the stage using the return statement.

## Act 2: Call Stack Ballet.

JavaScript orchestrates a ballet with the Call Stack as the choreographer.

### 1.Call Stack Choreography

The Call Stack, like a ballet master, controls the sequence of execution contexts. Each context joins the stack, with the highest commanding performance. As functions exit, so do their contexts, culminating in the Global Execution Context. The curtain falls, signalling the end of the program's performance.

## The grand finale: Execution Context's Swan Song.

In this grand finale, the Execution Context concludes the ballet of JavaScript code execution. The Call Stack, the unsung hero, maintains perfect performance by preserving the rhythm and sequence of execution contexts.

JavaScript's code execution, a ballet of memory, code, and context, creates a two-act narrative. A symphony organised by the Call Stack, a silent choreographer who ensures every move is in sync.

The curtain lowers, and the audience sees the end of a program's fascinating dance on the stage of code execution.

Stay tuned!! Happy Learning!!
